<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1.A measurement system can be accurate but not precise, precise but not accurate, neither, or both. For example, 
  if an experiment contains a error in the way it is done, then increasing the sample size generally increases precision but does not improve accuracy. The end result would be a consistent,
   yet inaccurate, set of results from the flawed experiment. Eliminating the systematic error improves accuracy but does not change.

   2.Currently, India has the seventh largest economy based on GDP, but it is poised to move up the list if current expansion trends there continue.
   This rapid expansion remains hampered by corruption at all levels of government and by endemic violence that plagues many of India's 29 states. In fact, were it not for
    these twin issues, India would likely already enjoy a more robust economy — economists estimate India lost out on more than $1 trillion because of violence in 2017 alone.
   Troubles aside, India remains a massive global exporter, an agricultural powerhouse, and home to all 10 of the fastest growing cities in the world.
  
   3.According to a study published in the Official Publication of the Sleep Research Society, people who get between 7.5 and 9 hours of sleep are at least 20% more productive and effective
    at what they do. A well-rested employee will be psychologically calm, physically charged, and thinking more clearly. To ensure employees are well-rested, consider whether it makes sense to
    allow naps in the office. For example, Google has installed nap pods in their offices so employees can take intermittent naps and recover their energy during the day.
